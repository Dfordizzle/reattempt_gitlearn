# reattempt_gitlearn
This is a second attempt to push to Github
!! Success, how exciting * typed with a straight face
This is my first success pushing my repository to Github, i decided you all need to celebrate this milestone thats why i am updating this README
I am pretty sure my future self would be hysterical reading this.


I hope there is a delete option somewhere , ild have to look for that.
